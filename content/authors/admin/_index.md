I'm an M.Eng Computer Science student at Cornell University. At Cornell, I'm focusing my studies on Machine Learning, Intelligent Systems, and Cloud computing. Before this, I had a wonderful experience working at Oracle in India, where I built enterprise web-based software products (restful API, microservices, focused on code coverage, stability and reliability of the services) using Java, Spring Boot, Ruby on Rails, elastic search and many other frameworks.

I have learned a lot from my time at Oracle and have grown personally and in my professional career. Through my work, learning, and personal projects, I have realized my passion for building products that have a tangible impact on the journeys and lives of users and stakeholders.

I'm currently looking for a full time opportunity in Software Development roles to utilize my potential to the fullest by developing products that solve challenging problems.
